__Content Security Policy__ is a security feature that helps protect your website against various types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), click jacking, and other code injection attacks. It works by defining a set of rules that control which resources (like scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) can be loaded and executed on your website

#### ~={green}How It's Working=~ :

~={red}Define the Policy =~: You specify the policy in your website's HTTP headers or by using a         <~={orange}meta=~> tag. This policy includes directives that define the allowed sources for different types of content

~={red}Apply the Policy=~ : When a user's browser visits your website, it reads the CSP rules and enforces them. This helps prevent malicious content from being executed on your site

~={red}Report Violations=~ : CSP can also be configured to report violations, so you can monitor and address any issues that arise

#### ~={green}Example=~ :

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
```

__default-src 'self'__ : Allows content to be loaded only from the same origin as the site.

__img-src__ : Allows images to be loaded from any source.

__script-src 'self'__ : Allows scripts to be loaded only from the same origin.

__style-src 'self'__ : Allows styles to be loaded only from the same origin.

By using CSP, you can significantly enhance the security of your website and protect your users from potential threats. If you want to implement it on your website, you can start by specifying a simple policy and gradually make it more restrictive as you test and refine it.
